This is my practice for basic scraping skills by using python.
I practiced scraping both static pages and interactive pages.
Basicly I used requests,BeautifluSoup,selenium modules to do web scraping.
Also I tried to use tweepy api to scrape some twitter accounts,which is not very successful.
I will try to read the tweepy documentation carefully to solve the problem.
